        Why blazor and web assembly?
    </MudText>
    <MudSpacer/>
    <MudText>When i started this project i wanted to have a new way to learn a new way to develop for the web.I have liked the idea of Webassembly, so i decided that this was the perfect opportunity to learn it, so here we are. I have already tried to use a bit razor pages and C# (and really liked it), so this seems like the next step. This page is meant for me to have some fun!</MudText>

        One of the biggest drawback of web assembly is that is somewhat slow, so i will continuously try to optimize this website as i see fit, under you can see what i have done:
    </MudText>
    <MudList T="string">
        <MudListItem>Removed CDN where possible</MudListItem>
        <MudListItem>Trying to remove unused CSS where possible (as removing entire libraries that are not in use, why was bootstrap here??)</MudListItem>
        <MudListItem>Optimize Items</MudListItem>
    </MudList>
    <MudText>As of most places have ok - connection, then mostly for the user experience, and it is actually kinda fun</MudText>

        Deploying in many ways.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">As webassembly compiles to a static website in this context, i could have used many different ways to deploy the initial static website, so i decided to use Cloudflare pages, but as long as it can use a build script i should be good! But i like to have things in one place</MudText>

    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2">The gigantic JSON object</MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        The last couple of weeks i have been fighting with a huge <abbr title="Javascript Object Notation">json</abbr> object. The object i am talking about is of course the live CVE feed that are under the <a href="/cybersec">cybersecurity</a> tab. The first challenge was to map this to a excisting <abbr title="Data Transfer Object">DTO</abbr>. This would be essential for me to load the object as i wanted.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h3">Breakdown of the json object</MudText>
    <MudText>Luckly for me we live in a modern time, with modern solutions, so of course i used some modern tools. First the provider of the API that i used, <abbr title="National Institution of Technology">NIST</abbr> provided a pretty neat schema of the data, so a combination of that, and use of <a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">hoppscotch</a>, to generate and get a closer look at the code helped me a lot, so big up to them!</MudText>
    <MudText>The Object mainly consists of:</MudText>
    <MudList T="string">
       <MudListItem> ResultPerPage: This you can use to define how many of a object you want to get</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> StartIndex: Which index you are getting the results from (0 is the first page of the params you decide)</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> TotalResults: says how many CVE you are getting</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> Format: what format the CVE is</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> Version: Wich CVE version it is</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> TimeStamp: when the data is from</MudListItem>
       <MudListItem> Vulnarbilities[]: The Feed itself</MudListItem>
